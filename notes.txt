configure node project so we can write npm test

say success or failure (with report)

On laptop, we have our project.

We push it to github.  Which only hosts code - doesn't have testing service.

We connect circleCI to github as a service.

CircleCI lets us say "You can / can't merge changes"

npm install --save-dev jest

make a file called filename.test.js
export functions from file to test
import file into test file
